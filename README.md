The game challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors as it grows longer with each successful round.

- Interactive Buttons: Players interact with the game by clicking on colored buttons to replicate the displayed sequence.

- Game Over Message: When a player makes a mistake and fails to reproduce the correct sequence, a "VOCÃŠ ERROU!" (YOU GOT IT WRONG!) message appears, indicating the end of the game.

- Restart Option: After receiving the game over message, players can choose to restart the game by clicking the "RESTART" button.

- Exit Option: If players prefer to stop playing, they can click the "GET OUT" button to exit the game.
